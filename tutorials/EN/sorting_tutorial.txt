p:This tutorial will show you how to use the sorting options in Olex2. The first thing this tutorial will do is to load <b>Sucrose</b> as an example to show this.
c:freeze(true)
c:reap 'DataDir()/samples/sucrose/sucrose.res'
c:spy.revert_to_original()
c:freeze(false)

p:Click on the <b>Work</b> tab in the top toolbar.
h:tab-work
c:spy.demo.switch_tab_for_tutorials(work)

p:Then select the <b>Sorting</b> tab.
h:h2-sorting
c:html.ItemState h2-work-sorting 1

p:The four drop-down menus under 'Sort Order' in this tab allow atoms to be sorted in any desired order, e.g., by part number first, then by atomic number (<i>Z</i>), and finally by atomic label.

p:Clicking the <b>Sort</b> button will re-sort the atoms in the structure according to your preferences selected from the drop-down menu and output the sorted list on the screen.
h:small-Sort
#c:html.call(IMG_BUTTON-SORT.onclick)
c:html.setvalue(sorting_moiety, None)
c:spy.SetParam('user.sorting.moiety', html.GetValue('sorting_moiety'))
c:spy.gui.do_sort()
c:refresh

p:After sorting, select all atoms and type 'info' in the command line to print out a table of results (atomic coordinates, Ueq's, etc.) in the command window.
c:sel $*
c:info
c:refresh

p:In order to see all the lines of text in the command window, type the command '<c>lines -1</c>'.
c:lines -1
c:refresh

p:If there is still insufficient space on the screen to view the entire table, type '<c>text</c>' to open a text file containing the screen output. You can also open this text file by clicking on the notepad icon at the top of the GUI window.
h:toolbar-text
c:text

p:To make it easier to find the relevant information, type in the command '<c>clear</c>' first to clear the display screen.
c:clear

p: Next, select all atoms and sort them as desired.
#c:html.call(IMG_BUTTON-SORT.onclick)
c:sel $*
c:spy.gui.do_sort()

p:Type '<c>info</c>' again to display the table.
c:info

p:To open the whole data table in a text file, click on the notepad icon as before or type '<c>text</c>'.
c:text

p:It is also possible to sort from the command line. For example, '<c>sort +al</c>' will sort the table alphabetically by atom label, after which the results can be displayed with the '<c>info</c>' command as before.
c:sort +al
c:sel $*
c:info
c:refresh

p:To sort by atomic mass, type '<c>sort +m</c>'. The '<c>info</c>' command will again display the re-sorted table.
c:sort +m
c:sel $*
c:info
c:refresh

p:The last function in the <b>Sorting</b> tab is <b>Moieties</b> which allows you to sort atoms in structures like <b>ZP2</b>, that have more than one molecular entity in the asymmetric unit, in a split format. <b>ZP2</b> will now be loaded.
c:freeze(true)
c:reap 'DataDir()/samples/ZP2/ZP2'
c:spy.revert_to_original()
c:freeze(false)

p:Select an option such as 'Mass' from the <b>Moiety</b> drop-down menu to sort the moieties by mass first. (In this case, both moieties have the same mass.) Next, click on the <b>Sort</b> button as before to sort atoms <i>separately in each moiety</i>.
c:html.setvalue(sorting_moiety, Mass)
c:spy.SetParam('user.sorting.moiety', html.GetValue('sorting_moiety'))
c:spy.gui.do_sort()
c:refresh

p:You can view the resulting data table (after selecting all the atoms) with the '<c>info</c>' (or '<c>text</c>') command as above. Within each moiety, the atoms will be sorted according to the sort order chosen in the GUI, e.g., by part, then by atomic number, then by atom label.
c:clear
c:sel $*
c:info

p:You can combine these sorting options to get various types of sorted tables. Type '<c>help sort</c>' to see all the options available.
c:help sort
c:refresh

p:As an example of the use of this line command, let us mix the moiety sort with the mass and label sort. To do this, type into the command line '<c>sort +ml moiety</c>'.
c:sort +ml moiety
c:refresh

p:Selecting all atoms and typing '<c>info</c>' displays the usual atomic information as a table with atoms sorted by their atomic mass but still ordered by moiety, and with their respective labels.
c:sel $*
c:info

p:You can also switch the order of appearance of molecules in the moiety list by adding an extra part to the end of the command line, so for example in the example we are using, you enter in the command '<c>sort +ml moiety F2 F1</c>'. As before, select all atoms and type '<c>info</c>' (or '<c>text</c>') to view the resulting table.
c:sort +ml moiety F2 F1
c:sel $*
c:info
c:refresh

p:End of tutorial. Press 'Next' to repeat the tutorial or 'Cancel' to exit.
