p:This tutorial will look at how to use the pack function in Olex 2 in order to show how the molecules interact with each other. The first thing this tutorial will do is to load sucrose as an example to show this.

p:First you need to click on the <b>View</b> tab in the top toolbar.
h:tab-view
c:spy.demo.switch_tab_for_tutorials(view)

p:Then you need to open the toolbar called <b>Symmetry Generation</b> by clicking it, which will extend the tab
h:h2-symmetry-generation
c:html.ItemState h2-view-symmetry-generation 1

p:...you then need to open the tab called <b>Packing</b>.
h:h3-Packing
c:html.ItemState h3-packing 1

p:You can then either choose using the slider how many units you want to pack the molecule by
c:html.setbg(slidepackradius,red)
c:html.setvalue(slidepackradius,15)
c:html.setvalue(packradius,15)
c:setvalue(packradius,getvalue(slidepackradius))
c:pack getvalue(packradius)
c:refresh

p:...or you can choose to type the command '<c>pack</c>' to show the maximum amount allowed to be shown.
c:pack
c:refresh

p:You can move, rotate and use functions on these as you would for a normal single unit of the molecule, for example here is the molecule rotating 90 degrees along the x axis.
c:rota x 90
c:refresh

p:In order to reduce this back down to a single unit again you have to click on the tab called <b>Symmetry Tools</b>.
c:html.ItemState h3-packing 2
h:h3-Symmetry-Tools
c:html.ItemState h3-symmetry-tools 1

p:Once on the Symmetry Tools tab you need to click on <b>Fuse</b> in order to reduce the model to one unit again or type the command '<c>fuse</c>'.
