p:This tutorial will look at how to use the packing features in Olex2, in order to show how the molecules in a crystal structure interact with one another. The first thing this tutorial will do is to load the <b>Sucrose</b> example structure.
c:freeze(true)
c:reap 'DataDir()/samples/sucrose/sucrose.res'

c:freeze(false)

p:First, click on the <b>View</b> tab toolbar.
h:tab-view
c:spy.demo.switch_tab_for_tutorials(view)

p:Next, click on the <b>Symmetry Generation</b> tool tab to show the available commands.
h:h2-symmetry-generation
c:html.ItemState h2-view-symmetry-generation 1

p:Now open the <b>Packing</b> tool tab.
h:h3-Packing
c:html.ItemState h3-packing 1

p:You can now choose how many repeating units you want to pack onto the screen. One way is by using the <b>Pack Radius</b> slider.
c:html.setbg(slidepackradius,red)
c:html.setvalue(slidepackradius,15)
c:html.setvalue(packradius,15)
c:html.setvalue(packradius,html.getvalue(slidepackradius))
c:pack html.getvalue(packradius)
c:refresh

p:Type '<c>fuse</c> at the command line to redisplay the asymmetric unit alone. (This is a very much-used command.)
c:fuse
c:refresh

p:To display the unit cell, type '<c>cell</c>'. (The display can be switched off by typing '<c>cell</c>' again.)
c:cell
c:refresh

p:To display the structure out to the currently defined limits set for <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>, click on the <b>Pack to limits</b> link or type '<c>pack</c>'.
c:pack
c:refresh

p:You can move, rotate and use functions on these as you would for a normal single unit of the molecule. For example here is the molecule rotating 90 degrees along the x axis.
c:rota x 90
c:refresh

p:In order to reduce this back down to a single unit again you have to click on the tab called <b>Symmetry Tools</b>.
c:html.ItemState h3-packing 2
h:h3-Symmetry-Tools
c:html.ItemState h3-symmetry-tools 1

p:Once on the <b>Symmetry Tools</b> tab you need to click on <b>Fuse</b> in order to reduce the model to one unit again, or type the command '<c>fuse</c>'.
