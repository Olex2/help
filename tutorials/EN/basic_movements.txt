p:Welcome to Olex2, used to create 3D models for small-molecule structure solution and refinement. This tutorial for new users of Olex2 will go over some of the basic controls used for navigation. On startup, Olex2 automatically opens the last crystal structure used, but when the software is opened for the first time, the model for sucrose is loaded.

p:One of the most useful things to start using is the left mouse button, which is used to rotate the structure on the screen. Try it!

p:The structure can also be rotated by typing '<c>rota</c>' on the command line. A direction such as x,y or z must be specified along with the degrees of rotation. For example, '<c>rota x 90</c>' rotates the structure about the x axis by 90&deg.
c:rota x 90
c:refresh

p:You should have noticed that the molecule rotated 90 degrees in the x direction you can also zoom in and out of a molecule by holding the right mouse button and moving it backwards and forwards.
c:zoom(eval(0.3-zoom()))
c:refresh

p:The command window will have now zoomed in on the molecule. If you are having problems seeing the molecule easily, because of the gradient colour, you can quite easily change the gradient colour by pressing <b>F2</b>.
c:zoom(eval(0.1-zoom()))
c:swapbg
c:refresh

p:You can also change the gradient so that it ends up being slightly lighter on the bottom and slightly darker on the top by pressing <b>F4</b>.
c:grad -i
c:refresh

p:Another helpful keyboard shortcut is <b>ctrl+Q</b> this will toggle the electron densities that appear on the molecule.
c:showq
c:refresh

p:You can also toggle how the hydrogen atoms are shown in the molecule by pressing <b>ctrl+h</b>. This will cause them to either disappear, reappear or shows them with internal h bonds.
c:showh
c:refresh

p:Also if you make a mistake while constructing your model in order to revert back to an older point in the model you need to click on the tab at the top called <b>Work</b>.
h:tab-work
c:spy.demo.switch_tab_for_tutorials(work)

p:Then you need to click on the tab called <b>History</b>.
h:h2-history
c:html.ItemState h2-work-history 1

p:In this tab you should be able to see some coloured columns. If you click on one of these columns then it will revert back to a previous version of your structure.

p:Also if you've created a couple of models from the same data set you can go to past solutions by clicking on the tab <b>History Tree</b>.
h:h3-History-Tree
c:html.ItemState h3-history-tree 1

p:Then simply choose a past solution by double clicking on it.

p:End of tutorial. Press next to repeat the tutorial or cancel to exit.
