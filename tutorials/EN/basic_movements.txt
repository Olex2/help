p:Welcome to Olex2 this software will be able to help you in creating 3D models for small-molecule structure solution and refinement, the first thing this tutorial will do is to load sucrose as an example to show this.
c:freeze(true)
c:reap 'DataDir()/samples/sucrose/sucrose.res'
c:spy.revert_to_original()

c:freeze(false)

p:This tutorial will teach you some of the basic controls in order to navigate round this software if you are a new user to Olex2

p:To start with the last crystal structure that was used on the system should automatically be opened when the software is started if this is the first time you have used Olex2 then the model for Sucrose should be loaded.

p:One of the most useful things to first start using is the left click on the molecule in order to rotate it, you can also use the command line <c>rota</c>

p:In order to use the command line you will have to enter in the command <c>rota</c> along with a direction such as x,y or z and the number of degrees you want it to rotate for example <c>rota x 90</c>
c:rota x 90
c:refresh

p:You should have noticed that the molecule rotated 90 degrees in the x direction you can also zoom in and out of a molecule by holding the right mouse button and moving it backwards and forwards
c:zoom(eval(0.3-zoom()))
c:refresh

p:The command window will have now zoomed in on the molecule. If you are having problems seeing the molecule easily ,because of the gradient colour, you can quite easily change the gradient colour by pressing <b>F2</b>.
c:zoom(eval(0.1-zoom()))
c:swapbg
c:refresh

p:You can also change the gradient so that it ends up being slightly lighter on the bottom and slightly darker on the top by pressing <b>F4</b>
c:grad -i
c:refresh

p:Another helpful keyboard shortcut is <b>ctrl+Q</b> this will toggle the electron densities that appear on the molecule
c:showq
c:refresh

p:You can also toggle how the hydrogen atoms are shown in the molecule by pressing <b>ctrl+h</b> this will cause them to either disappear,reappear or shows them with internal h bonds
c:showh
c:refresh

p:Also if you make a mistake while constructing your model in order to revert back to an older point in the model you need to click on the tab at the top called <b>work</b>
h:tab-work
c:spy.demo.switch_tab_for_tutorials(work)

p:Then you need to click on the tab called <b>history</b>
h:h2-history
c:html.ItemState h2-work-history 1

p:In this tab you should be able to see some coloured columns if you click on one of these columns then it will revert back to a previous version of your structure

p:Also if you've created a couple of models from the same data set you can go to past solutions by clicking on the tab <b>History Tree</b>
h:h3-h3-history-tree
c:html.ItemState h3-history-tree 1

p:Then simply choose a past solution by double clicking on it

p:End of tutorial, press next to repeat the tutorial or cancel to exit.
