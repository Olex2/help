p:This tutorial will look at how to get geometrical measurements and analyses from your 3D model using the Olex2 system and the sample structure <b>THPP</b>.
c:freeze(true)
c:reap 'DataDir()/samples/THPP/THPP.res'
c:spy.revert_to_original()
c:mpln -n
c:showQ False
c:freeze(false)

p:To start, click on the <b>View</b> tab.
h:tab-view
c:spy.demo.switch_tab_for_tutorials(view)

p:Next, select the <b>Geometry</b> tool tab.
h:h2-geometry
c:html.ItemState h2-view-geometry 1

p:In this tab there are six different buttons to analyse your model and gather geometric data from it. The first one we will look at is <b>Mean Plane</b> (of active selection).

p:In order to use this feature, one of the rings in the structure must be highlighted. To do this you can hold <b>shift</b> to draw a box over one of the rings with the mouse, or click on each ring atom to select it manually.
c:sel N3 C2 C1 C10 C9 C4
c:refresh

p:Once the atoms are highlighted, click on the <b>Mean Plane</b> button and the average plane for the selected atoms will be produced on the model. Alternatively, the command '<c>mpln sel</c>' can be entered.
c:mpln sel
c:refresh

p:Once the mean plane has been worked out a table containing the results should appear in the text output along with the data for the plane normal and the rms deviation of the atomic positions from the mean plane (in Å).

p:In order to get rid of the plane it first needs to be selected by clicking on it. Then you can either press the <b>Delete</b> key on your keyboard or right-click on the plane and choose to either hide it or delete it from there.
c:sel TXPlane0
c:kill sel
c:refresh

p:The next function will allow you to find the best line between the selected options by clicking on <b>Best Line</b> (of active selection).

p:You can either choose to get an overall best line by selecting the entire molecule by holding <b>ctrl+A</b>...
c:sel -a
c:line

p:To align the molecule along the best line use '<c>line -n</c>'.
c:sel -a
c:line -n

p:And to get the current view normal, use the '<c>direction</c>' command.
c:direction

p:The view will now have changed so that you are looking down the best line of the active selection...
c:rota y 90
c:refresh

p:...or you can get one between a minimum of 2 atoms in your structure.
c:sel TXLine0
c:kill sel
c:sel N12 C41
c:line sel

p:This will also view down the best line.
c:rota y 90

p:The next function in the tab is <b>Distance and Angles(of selection)</b> which will give the distance and angle of up to 4 atoms in the molecule by selecting them before hand, or you could also type the command '<c>sel</c>' after you have chosen which atoms you would like to measure. <br>The data will then be displayed in the text in the command window 
c:sel TXLine0
c:kill sel
c:sel F1 C7 N6 C5
c:sel

p:Then there is <b>Refine and save esd info</b> which needs to be clicked once in order to use the rest of the functions in the list as this will refine the model and calculate the needed esd information.
c:delins more
c:addins more -3
c:refine

p:The next function, <b>Distance and Angles with esd(of selection)</b> will allow you to view the current esd information of up to 4 atoms. Select 4 atoms in the structure.
c:sel N12 C12 C9 C8
c:refresh

p:Then select the link or enter in the command '<c>esd</c>'.
c:esd
c:refresh

p:This will then cause the data to appear in the command window in the software.

p:The next function to be looked at is <b>Analyse &pi;-&pi; Interactions</b> to use this function simply click on the link without highlighting anything.
c:pipi -g
c:rota x 90
c:refresh

p:This should have duplicated the molecules to show ring interaction and given some data in the command window.
c:fuse
c:refresh

p:Another command you could also use would be the '<c>htab</c>' command.

p:If the command '<c>htab</c>' is entered into the command line, then this will add in found hydrogen bonds to the list for the refinement programme to add to the CIF file.

p:The next command would not work on the currently loaded molecule so the model for <b>Sucrose</b> will be loaded in order to show an example of the command working.
c:reap 'DataDir()/samples/Sucrose/Sucrose.res'

p:You can also cause the molecules to grow and show hydrogen bond interactions between molecules by typing in the command '<c>htab -g</c>'.
c:htab -g
c:refresh

p:There is also another <b>htab</b> command that can be used which is '<c>htab -t</c>'  which will allow you to attach unconventional hydrogen bonds to atoms. For example if the command was '<c>htab -t=Br,I</c>', this would cause the Br to gain a bond with I.
