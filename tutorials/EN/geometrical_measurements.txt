p:This tutorial will look at how to get geometrical measurements and analyses from your 3D model using the Olex2 system and the sample structure <b>THPP</b>.

p:To start, click on the <b>View</b> tab.
h:tab-view
c:spy.demo.switch_tab_for_tutorials(view)

p:Next, select the <b>Geometry</b> tool tab.
h:h2-geometry
c:html.ItemState h2-view-geometry 1

p:In this tab there are six different buttons to analyse your model and gather geometric data from it. The first one we will look at is <b>Mean Plane</b> (of active selection).

p:To see how this feature is used, highlight one of the rings in the structure. To do this, hold <b>shift</b> and draw a box over one of the rings with the mouse, or click on each ring atom to select it manually.
c:sel N3 C2 C1 C10 C9 C4
c:refresh

p:Once the atoms are highlighted, click on the <b>Mean Plane</b> button and the average plane for the selected atoms will be produced on the model. Alternatively, enter the command '<c>mpln sel</c>'.
c:mpln -n=DEMO_PLANE
c:refresh

p:Once the mean plane has been worked out, a table containing the results appears in the text output along with the data for the plane normal (hkl direction) and the rms deviation (in &Aring) of the atomic positions from the mean plane.

p:To remove the plane, first click on it to select it. Then either press the <b>Delete</b> key on your keyboard or right-click on the plane and choose to either hide it or delete it from there.
c:sel collection DEMO_PLANE
c:kill
c:refresh

p:The next function will allow you to find the best line through the selected atoms by clicking on <b>Best Line</b> (of active selection).

p:To get an overall best line through the whole molecule, select all atoms with <b>ctrl+A</b> and click <b>Best Line</b>.
c:sel -a
c:line -n=DEMO_LINE_ALL_ATOMS

p:To align the molecule along the best line use '<c>line -n</c>'.
c:sel -a
c:line -n

p:The view will now have changed so that you are looking along the best line of the active selection. The '<c>direction</c>' command prints the current orientation of the model (in fractional coordinates).
c:direction

p:The view may be rotated around the x, y, or z axis using the 'rota' command, e.g., '<c>rota y 90</c>' provides a view perpendicular to the Best Line. To delete a line, click on it and press the delete key.
c:rota y 90
c:refresh

p:Alternatively, you can draw a line through a minimum of two selected atoms in your structure.
c:kill DEMO_LINE_ALL_ATOMS
c:sel N5 C10
c:line sel -n=DEMO_LINE_TWO_ATOMS

p:The next function in the Geometry tool tab is <b>Distances and Angles</b> (of selection).
c:kill DEMO_LINE_TWO_ATOMS

p:Select up to four atoms, then click the <b>Distances and Angles</b> button or type '<c>sel</c>'; the geometric data pertaining to your selection will appear in the command window.
c:sel -u
c:sel C11 C10 C1 F1
c:sel
c:refresh

p:The <b>Refine and Save e.s.d. info</b> button needs to be clicked once to refine the model and calculate needed e.s.d.'s.
c:sel -u
c:delins more
c:addins more -3
c:refine

p:Select up to four atoms. (Here, we will select the same four atoms as before.) Typing '<c>esd</c>' will then cause the e.s.d. data for your selection to appear in the command window in the software.
c:sel -u
c:sel C11 C10 C1 F1
c:esd
c:refresh

p:Now the same geometric parameters are displayed as before, with their respective e.s.d.'s.

p:To use the <b>Analyse &pi;-&pi; Interactions</b> function, simply click on the button without highlighting anything.
c:pipi -g
c:rota x 90
c:refresh

p:This will duplicate the molecules to show interactions between adjacent aromatic rings and print the relevant geometric data, such as the distance between ring centroids, in the command window.
c:fuse
c:refresh

p:The last button, <b>Analyse Hydrogen Bonds</b> provides a view of the hydrogen bonds in a structure. The model for <b>Sucrose</b> will be used to demonstrate this feature.
c:reap 'DataDir()/samples/Sucrose/Sucrose.res'

p:Clicking the <b>Analyse Hydrogen Bonds</b> button shows both the intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the structure. The line command "htab -g" may also be used instead. These hydrogen bonds will be entered in the list for the refinement programme to be added to the CIF file.
c:fuse
c:htab -g
c:refresh

p:Another useful command for analysing nonbonding interactions is '<c>htab -t</c>'. For example, '<c>htab -t=Br,I</c>' would cause a Br---I halogen bond to be displayed.
