p:This tutorial will look at how to get geometrical measurements and analyses from your 3D model using the Olex2 system and the sample structure <b>THPP</b>.
c:freeze(true)
c:reap 'DataDir()/samples/THPP/THPP.res'
c:spy.revert_to_original()
c:mpln -n
c:showQ False
c:freeze(false)

p:To start, click on the <b>View</b> tab.
h:tab-view
c:spy.demo.switch_tab_for_tutorials(view)

p:Next, select the <b>Geometry</b> tool tab.
h:h2-geometry
c:html.ItemState h2-view-geometry 1

p:In this tab there are six different buttons to analyse your model and gather geometric data from it. The first one we will look at is <b>Mean Plane</b> (of active selection).

p:To see how this feature is used, highlight one of the rings in the structure. To do this, hold <b>shift</b> and draw a box over one of the rings with the mouse, or click on each ring atom to select it manually.
c:sel N3 C2 C1 C10 C9 C4
c:refresh

p:Once the atoms are highlighted, click on the <b>Mean Plane</b> button and the average plane for the selected atoms will be produced on the model. Alternatively, enter the command '<c>mpln sel</c>'.
c:mpln sel
c:refresh

p:Once the mean plane has been worked out, a table containing the results should appear in the text output along with the data for the plane normal and the rms deviation (in &Aring) of the atomic positions from the mean plane.

p:To remove the plane, first click on it to select it. Then either press the <b>Delete</b> key on your keyboard or right-click on the plane and choose to either hide it or delete it from there.
c:sel TXPlane0
c:kill sel
c:refresh

p:The next function will allow you to find the best line through the selected atoms by clicking on <b>Best Line</b> (of active selection).

p:To get an overall best line through the whole molecule, select all atoms with <b>ctrl+A</b> and click <b>Best Line</b>.
c:sel -a
c:line

p:To align the molecule along the best line use '<c>line -n</c>'.
c:sel -a
c:line -n

p:And to get the current view normal, use the '<c>direction</c>' command.
c:direction

p:The view will now have changed so that you are looking down the best line of the active selection.
c:rota y 90
c:refresh

p:Alternatively, you can draw a line through a minimum of two atoms in your structure.
c:sel TXLine0
c:kill sel
c:sel N5 C10
c:line sel

p:This will also view down the best line.
c:rota y 90

p:The next function in the tab is <b>Distance and Angles(of selection)</b> which will give the distance and angle of up to 4 atoms in the molecule by selecting them before hand, or you could also type the command '<c>sel</c>' after you have chosen which atoms you would like to measure. <br>The data will then be displayed in the text in the command window 
c:sel TXLine0
c:kill sel
c:sel F1 C7 N6 C5
c:sel

p:Then there is <b>Refine and save esd info</b> which needs to be clicked once in order to use the rest of the functions in the list as this will refine the model and calculate the needed esd information.
c:delins more
c:addins more -3
c:refine

p:The next function, <b>Distance and Angles with esd(of selection)</b> will allow you to view the current esd information of up to 4 atoms. Select 4 atoms in the structure.
c:sel N12 C12 C9 C8
c:refresh

p:Then select the link or enter in the command '<c>esd</c>'.
c:esd
c:refresh

p:This will then cause the data to appear in the command window in the software.

p:The next function to be looked at is <b>Analyse &pi;-&pi; Interactions</b> to use this function simply click on the link without highlighting anything.
c:pipi -g
c:rota x 90
c:refresh

p:This should have duplicated the molecules to show ring interaction and given some data in the command window.
c:fuse
c:refresh

p:Another command you could also use would be the '<c>htab</c>' command.

p:If the command '<c>htab</c>' is entered into the command line, then this will add in found hydrogen bonds to the list for the refinement programme to add to the CIF file.

p:The next command would not work on the currently loaded molecule so the model for <b>Sucrose</b> will be loaded in order to show an example of the command working.
c:reap 'DataDir()/samples/Sucrose/Sucrose.res'

p:You can also cause the molecules to grow and show hydrogen bond interactions between molecules by typing in the command '<c>htab -g</c>'.
c:htab -g
c:refresh

p:There is also another <b>htab</b> command that can be used which is '<c>htab -t</c>'  which will allow you to attach unconventional hydrogen bonds to atoms. For example if the command was '<c>htab -t=Br,I</c>', this would cause the Br to gain a bond with I.
