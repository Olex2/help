p:This tutorial will show you how to customise the GUI to a style that may help you to feel more comfortable when using Olex2. The sample structure for THPP will now be loaded in order to show how certain functions work later in the tutorial.
c:freeze(true)
c:reap 'DataDir()/samples/THPP/THPP.res'
c:spy.revert_to_original()
c:freeze(false)

p:Most of the functions in this technique are command based, as not many of them appear in the GUI.

p:The first command we are going to look at is the <b>setfont</b> command which will allow you to edit the font for any part of the software as long as the right area command is given after the command of 'setfont'.

p:So for example if you wanted to change the font of pictures and labels you would need to enter in the command '<c>setfont picture_labels choosefont()</c>' this will allow you to now select the font, font style, size and script.
c:setfont picture_labels choosefont()

p:The next command allows you to change the colours for specific areas in the software as long as the correct prefix is added onto the end of the command.

p:For example in order to edit material for the command name in the help window you need to enter in the command '<c>editmaterial helpcmd</c>' which will bring up a window where you can change the colour of many areas of the fonts, backgrounds and transparency.
c:editmaterial helpcmd

p:Some other prefixes for the commands are <b>helptxt</b> which allows you to edit material for the body of the help item...

p:...<b>execout</b> which allows you to edit material for the output text printed in the console of external programs...

p:...<b>error</b> which allows you to edit material for reporting errors in the console...

p:And <b>exception</b> which allows you to edit material for reporting exception in the console. 

p:Another useful function that can be entered into the command line is '<c>save</c>'. This will bring up the save as menu if no file name is provided. You also need to add in extra prefixes if you want certain settings saved which are scene, style, view, model.
c:save style

p:The next function to look at is '<c>load</c>' which will open the load menu if no file is provided,  you also need to add in extra prefixes if you want certain settings saved which are scene, style, view, model.
c:load style

p:The next function will allow you to change the colours that appear on the background gradient by entering in the command '<c>grad</c>'. This will open up a window from which you can choose the four corner colours which will change the background to any options that you may find easier for seeing the model or text.
c:grad

p:You can also put an image of your choice as the background by adding a '-p' to the previous command then the file name which you want to load, so it will be something like this '<c>grad -p="[file path]"</c>'. In order for the image to become the background you need to restart Olex2.

p:To return the background back to normal type the command '<c>grad -p=default</c>' then restart Olex2 again and it should change back to the default background.

p:Another command that can be used to edit the GUI is <b>brad</b>. This command will allow you to adjust the radii of the bonds by entering in the command '<c>brad [number]</c>', so for example entering in '<c>brad 3</c>' should have made the bonds 3 times bigger.
c:brad 3
c:refresh

p:The default value for brad is one so in order to get the bonds back to their normal size you need to enter in '<c>brad 1</c>'.
c:brad 1
c:refresh

p:This particular command you can use in the GUI by going to View in the toolbar then opening the tab Quick Drawing Styles.
h:tab-view
c:spy.demo.switch_tab_for_tutorials(view)
h:h2-quick-drawing-styles
c:html.ItemState h2-view-quick-drawing-styles 1

p:You can also have the model shown as spheres by typing the command '<c>ads sph</c>'. You can also do this by selecting the button <b>Balls & Sticks</b>.
h:ball-and-stick
c:ads sph

p:You can also choose to have the model shown with Ellipsoids by either selecting the button <b>Ellipsoids | H</b> or you can enter in the command '<c>ads elp</c>'.
c:html.setimage(IMG_BUTTON-ELLIPSOIDS_|_H,button-ellipsoids_|_hhighlight.png)
c:ads elp

p:Another command you can use is '<c>ads ort</c>' which is the same as 'elp', but spheres have one of the quadrants cut out. This command is not in the GUI.
c:html.setimage(IMG_BUTTON-ELLIPSOIDS_|_H,button-ellipsoids_|_h.png)
c:ads ort
c:refresh

p:The final command for this customisation is '<c>ads std</c>' which is a standalone atom (i.e. grown as a cross in wire-frame mode) which can also be found in the GUI as <b>Tubes</b>.
h:button-Tubes
c:ads std
c:refresh

p:The next command that is going to be looked at is '<b>arad</b>' which applies different radii to all/selected atoms.
c:ads elp
c:refresh

p:The first command is '<c>arad sfil</c>' which will cause sphere packing radii (as in ShelXTL XP). 
c:arad sfil
c:refresh

p:The next command is '<c>arad pers</c>' which is a fixed radii for model viewing.
c:arad pers
c:refresh

p:The next command is '<c>arad isot</c>' which gives each atom its own radius depending on the value of the Uiso or ADP.
c:arad isot
c:refresh

p:The next command is '<c>arad isoth</c>' this is the same as 'isot', but the H atoms are also displayed with their real Uiso's.
c:arad isoth
c:refresh

p:The next command is '<c>arad bond</c>' this will cause all atoms to get the same radii as the default bond radius. 
c:arad bond
c:refresh

p:The last command is '<c>arad vdw</c>' the default/loaded Van der Waals radii used in most of the calculations. 
c:arad vdw
c:refresh

p:The next command lets you adjust the amount of zoom on selected atoms so if a carbon is selected all the carbons will zoom out by the percentage given.
c:arad isoth
c:refresh

p:So for example if a carbon is selected and then told to be shrunk down to 50% of its actual size the command '<c>azoom 50</c>' would need to be typed into the command line.
c:sel C12 C9 C8 C7 C5 C10
c:azoom 50
c:refresh

p:Or if you were wanting to make the carbons 50% bigger you would need to enter the command '<c>azoom 150</c>'.
c:azoom 150
c:refresh

p:To return all the atoms back to there actual size simply type in the command '<c>azoom 100</c>'.
c:azoom 100
c:refresh
