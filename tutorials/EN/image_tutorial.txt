p:This tutorial will run you through how to capture images of your 3D model using the Olex2 system. The first thing this tutorial will do is to load sucrose as an example to show this.

p:First you need to click on the tab for <b>Tools</b>.
h:tab-tools
c:spy.demo.switch_tab_for_tutorials(tools)

p:Then click on the tab marked <b>Images</b>.
h:h2-images
c:html.ItemState h2-tools-images 1

p:When first opened there is a small section at the top that contains links that will help you with editing your model - so that you can have labels in the correct position on your model and also of any colour you would like.

p:The first line of links will allow you to add labels. The first link labelled <b>Add labels to the selected atoms</b> allows you to add labels to either atoms you have selected and, if none are selected, it will add them to all atoms.

p:The second link <b>to non H atoms</b> adds labels to all atoms except for the Hydrogen atoms.

p:The drop down box allows you to choose the style in which the labels appear.

p:The third line contains links which will allow you to personalise the colours of the labels more. The first link <b>Choose the label colour</b> allows you to change the colour of the label its self...

p:...the second link <b>Label Box</b> allows for the colour of the box to be changed colour..

p:...and the third option <b>Transparent Box</b> allows for any boxes that may have been placed on the labels to become transparent without having to go through the settings for the label.

p:Once you have the labels in a way that you like, you can now create an image of your model. The first tab allows you to create a bitmap image so click on the tab <b>Bitmap Images</b>.
h:h3-Bitmap-Images
c:html.ItemState h3-bitmap-images 1

p:There are 4 links at the top of the box when you first open up this tab. The top 2 lines <b>Choose Label Font (Olex2) and Choose Label Font (system)</b> allow for the font to be changed on Olex2 and in the image respectively...

p:...the second line of links <b>Choose Bond Label Font (Olex2) and Choose Bond Label Font (System)</b> also allow for the change in colour for both Olex2 and the image respectively but this time for the bonds.

p:You can then choose what to name the file, the type of file it will be saved as and also the size of the model in the file.

p:Once you've selected the settings you want click the button <b>Go!</b> in order to save your image.
h:small-Go!
c:html.ItemState small-Go!-images 1

p:The location of where the file has been saved will appear in the command box in the text. Just follow the address in order to find the file you just saved.
c:html.ItemState h3-bitmap-images 2

p:The next tab <b>Postscript Images</b> allows you to save images as Postscript images.
h:h3-Postscript-Images
c:html.ItemState h3-postscript-images 1

p:In order to view these files it is recommended that you download either <b>GS View</b> or <b>PS Viewer</b>. The <b>PS Viewer</b> is probably faster and easier to install but the <b>GS View</b> allows you to do more with the image.

p:Once the tab is open there are a lot of different settings which you can alter in order to get what you want to show up in the image, and once you have the settings you want simply click on the <b>GO</b> button.
h:small-GO

p:Again the command window will have the address showing of where the image was saved.
c:html.ItemState h3-postscript-images 2

p:The last tab is <b>Image Series</b> which allows you to create a series of images in a new folder that will play like a movie when you flick through the images quickly, as it takes a set of images while the model rotates.
h:h3-Image-Series
c:html.ItemState h3-image-series 1

p:Once the tab is opened you will see 4 boxes, the first box <b>Rotation around Axis</b> allows you to choose which axis the rotation takes place round with 1=X 2=Y and 3=Z...

p:...the second box <b>Degree</b> allows you to set how many degrees of rotation the model goes through for every image that is wanting to be taken...

p:...the third box <b>Number of Frames</b> allows you to choose how many frames are taken of the model...

p:...and the fourth box allows you to set what size you want each frame of the molecule to be.

p:Once you have it set to the settings you want you can click on the <b>GO</b> button which will start recording the frames and put them in a file named "movie".
h:button_small-go

p:The movie file should be saved where the rest of the images get saved to for this model, since it does not show the address for where the file gets saved to.
