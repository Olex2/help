p:This tutorial will demonstrate how to capture images of your 3D model using the Olex2 system. The 'Co110' example structure will now be loaded.

p:First click on the <b>Tools</b> tab.
h:tab-tools
c:spy.demo.switch_tab_for_tutorials(tools)

p:Now click on the tool tab marked <b>Images</b>.

c:html.ItemState h2-tools-images 1

p:The upper section of this tool tab is for labelling atoms and bonds in your model and customising the labels. The <b>selected</b> button labels atoms selected in the display. If none are selected, all atoms and bonds will be labelled. The <b>non-H</b> button labels only non-hydrogen atoms.<br><br> For this tutorial, click the <b>hetero</b> label, which only labels heteroatoms in the structure.
c:label -a $*-H,Q,C -type=spy.GetParam('user.image.label_symm_type') -symm=spy.GetParam('user.image.label_symm') -resi=_#

p:A label can be moved to any desired position by holding down the <b>SHIFT</b> key and dragging it with the mouse. To delete a label, click on it and hit the <b>delete</b> button.

p:Click on any bond(s) to be labelled and then on the <b>selected</b> button to display the bond distance in &Aring.

p:The <b>Symmetry label</b> drop-down menu provides for the addition of symmetry designations to atomic labels, and the <b>Style</b> menu allows for choice of label style.

p:Click <b>Choose the label colour</b> to change the color of the labels, and <b>Label Box</b> to set the properties of the bounding box surrounding each label.

p:Once the labels have been formatted as desired, the <b>Bitmap images</b> tool tab can be used to generate an image of the model.
h:h3-Bitmap-Images
c:html.ItemState h3-bitmap-images 1

p:Click '<b>Atom</b> Label Font (Olex2)' to change the properties of the atom label font used throughout Olex2. To use one of the system-supplied fonts for labels in the image, click the adjacent '(System Font)' link. The '<b>Bond</b> Label Font (Olex2)' and its adjacent '(System Font)' link work the same way for bonds.

p:Enter a name for the image file and choose the image type, the size of the model in the file, and other graphics parameters in the <b>Bitmap Images</b> tool tab.

p:Once these settings have been selected, click the <b>Go!</b> button to save the image.
#h:small-Go!
c:pict -pq  "thpp.png" -dpi=300 1154

p:The image file is saved in the same folder where the main files (e.g., .hkl, .ins) for the structure are located.
c:html.ItemState h3-bitmap-images 2

p:To save images in Postscript format, click <b>Postscript Images</b>. These images can then be viewed with <b>GS View</b> or <b>PS Viewer</b>, for example. (<b>PS Viewer</b> is probably faster and easier to install but <b>GS View</b> allows you to do more with the image.)
h:h3-Postscript-Images
c:html.ItemState h3-postscript-images 1

p:Choose the desired image settings within this tool tab, then click the <b>Go!</b> button to create the Postscript image in the usual work folder.

p:The <b>Image Series</b> tool tab is for creating a series of images that can be displayed in sequence to make a movie of your model rotating. The image series will be stored in a separate folder within the work folder.
h:h3-Image-Series
c:html.ItemState h3-image-series 1

p:The <b>Rotation around Axis</b> box sets the axis of rotation, with 1 = <i>x</i>, 2 = <i>y</i>, and 3 = <i>z</i>, <b>Number of Frames</b> sets the number of images in the series, <b>Degree</b> specifies the degrees by which the model is to be rotated between frames, and <b>Size</b> determines the size of the image in each frame.

p:Click on the <b>GO</b> button to create the frames. The image series will be stored in a folder named 'movie' in the work folder.
