p:This tutorial deals with modifying the Olex2 GUI to suit one's preferences. The sample structure for THPP will now be loaded.

p:Most of the functions in this tutorial are invoked with line commands (entered in the graphics window), as they are not in the GUI.

p:The '<c>setfont</c>' command specifies the font to be used anywhere in Olex2. The particular area for which the font is to be specified immediately follows '<c>setfont</c>' in the command.

p:For example, to change the font in pictures and labels, type '<c>setfont picture_labels choosefont()</c>'. This brings up a menu from which to select the font, font style, size and script. Select <b>OK</b> or <b>Cancel</b> in the menu to continue.
c:setfont picture_labels choosefont()

p:The '<c>editmaterial</c>' command allows the colour properties of any specified area in the software to be customised, with the name of the area immediately following '<c>editmaterial</c>', as before.

p:For example, in order to edit colour and other properties for the command name in the help window, enter '<c>editmaterial helpcmd</c>'. This will bring up a window in which font colours, backgrounds, transparency, etc. can be set. Select <b>OK</b> or <b>Cancel</b> in the menu to continue.
c:editmaterial helpcmd

p:Similarly, '<c>editmaterial helptxt</c>' specifies the properties of the body of help items.

p:The colour properties of the console output are modified with '<c>editmaterial execout</c>', while '<c>editmaterial error</c>' and '<c>editmaterial exception</c>' modify the colour properties of errors and exceptions reported in the console, respectively.

p:Frequently used display styles, scene properties, etc. can be conveniently saved with the '<c>save</c>' command. For example, '<c>save style</c>' saves the current style. Select <b>Save</b> or <b>Cancel</b> in the menu to continue.
c:save style

p:In the same way, one can also use 'scene', 'view', or 'model' with the save command. (The view will be saved as a .xlv file and the model as a .oxm file in the working directory for the structure.)

p:The '<c>load</c>' command is used to reapply any saved style, scene, etc. For example, '<c>load style</c>' opens a menu to apply a previously saved style. Select <b>Open</b> or <b>Cancel</b> in the menu to continue.
c:load style

p:A previously saved view or model is simply recalled by typing '<c>load view</c>' or '<c>load model</c>', respectively.

p:To change the colours of the background gradient, enter '<c>grad</c>'. This will open up a window in which the four corner colours of the background can be set as desired. Select <b>OK</b> or <b>Cancel</b> in the menu to continue.
c:grad

p:It is possible to use an image as the background by adding '-p=' to the '<c>grad</c>' command, followed by the name of the image file, as '<c>grad -p="[file path]"</c>'. This can be useful for simultaneously displaying two different views of the model on the screen.

p:To return to the normal background, type '<c>grad -p=default</c>'. When Olex2 is restarted, the default background will be shown.

p:The '<c>brad</c>' command adjusts bond radii. So, for example, '<c>brad 3</c>' will make the displayed bonds three times thicker than normal.
c:brad 3
c:refresh

p:To get the bonds back to their default thickness of 1, type '<c>brad 1</c>'.
c:brad 1
c:refresh

p:A number of structure drawing styles are available in Olex2. To see these options, first click the <b>View</b> tab.
h:tab-view
c:spy.demo.switch_tab_for_tutorials(view)

p:Now open the <b>Quick Drawing Styles</b> tool tab.
h:h2-quick-drawing-styles
c:html.ItemState h2-view-quick-drawing-styles 1

p:To display atoms as perfect spheres, click the <b>Balls and Sticks</b> icon in this tool tab or type '<c>pers</c>'.
h:toolbar-ball-and-stick@#name
c:pers
c:refresh

p:To return to the standard thermal ellipsoid display click the <b>Ellipsoid</b> icon or enter '<c>telp</c>' at the command prompt. (The ellipsoid icon with an 'H' on it is very similar.)
h:toolbar-anis@#name
c:telp
c:refresh

p:A wire-frame display is sometimes helpful in viewing large or congested structures. To show the model in this view, click the <b>Wire Frame</b> icon.
h:toolbar-wireframe@#name
c:proj
c:refresh

p:Other views such as the space-filling mode and the tube mode are also available from this tool tab. The line commands for these views are '<c>sfil</c>' and '<c>sfil</c>', respectively.
h:toolbar-sphere-packing@#name
h:toolbar-bicoloured-bonds@#name
c:pers
c:telp
c:refresh

p:A display style not in the GUI shows atoms with one octant cut out of each ellipsoid. Type '<c>ads ort</c>' to access this view.
c:ads ort
c:refresh

p:The next command that is going to be looked at is '<b>arad</b>' which applies different radii to all/selected atoms.

p:The first command is '<c>arad sfil</c>' which will cause sphere packing radii (as in ShelXTL XP). 
c:arad sfil
c:refresh

p:The next command is '<c>arad pers</c>' which is a fixed radii for model viewing.
c:arad pers
c:refresh

p:The next command is '<c>arad isot</c>' which gives each atom its own radius depending on the value of the Uiso or ADP.
c:arad isot
c:refresh

p:The next command is '<c>arad isoth</c>' this is the same as 'isot', but the H atoms are also displayed with their real Uiso's.
c:arad isoth
c:refresh

p:The next command is '<c>arad bond</c>' this will cause all atoms to get the same radii as the default bond radius. 
c:arad bond
c:refresh

p:The last command is '<c>arad vdw</c>' the default/loaded Van der Waals radii used in most of the calculations. 
c:arad vdw
c:refresh

p:The next command lets you adjust the amount of zoom on selected atoms so if a carbon is selected all the carbons will zoom out by the percentage given.
c:arad isoth
c:refresh

p:So for example if a carbon is selected and then told to be shrunk down to 50% of its actual size the command '<c>azoom 50</c>' would need to be typed into the command line.
c:sel C12 C9 C8 C7 C5 C10
c:azoom 50
c:refresh

p:Or if you were wanting to make the carbons 50% bigger you would need to enter the command '<c>azoom 150</c>'.
c:azoom 150
c:refresh

p:To return all the atoms back to there actual size simply type in the command '<c>azoom 100</c>'.
c:azoom 100
c:refresh
