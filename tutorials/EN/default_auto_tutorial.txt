p:The files needed for solving and refining a crystal structure with Olex2 are a reflection file (<b>name.hkl</b>) and an input file (<b>name.ins</b>) containing the crystallographic unit cell that was determined during the diffraction experiment. These files should have the same name and reside in the same folder, normally accessed with the <b>Open</b> button.

p:Olex2 comes with several sample structures, which are shown as buttons in this tab. The <b>Sucrose</b> structure will be solved and refined in this tutorial. Press 'Next' to load it.

p:To access all the main solution and refinement tools in Olex2, click the <b>Work</b> tab.

p:From this tab, one can <b>Solve</b>, <b>Refine</b>, <b>Draw</b> and produce a final <b>Report</b> for a structure.
h:btn-solve;1
h:btn-refine;1

h:btn-report;1

p:Click on the arrow next to the <b>Solve</b> button to set the solve options.
c:html.ItemState cbtn* 1 cbtn-solve 2 *settings 0 solve-settings 1

p:Here, choose a solution program from the <b>Program</b> drop-down menu (e.g., ShelXT, olex.solve), make sure <b>name.hkl</b> is loaded as the <b>Reflections</b> file, and enter the expected molecular formula in <b>Composition</b>.
c:spy.set_solution_program(olex2.solve,,snum)
c:html.Update
c:SetVar(solution_output, strcat(FileName(),_solution_output.html))

p:Click the <b>Solve</b> button or type '<c>solve</c>' into the command window to solve the structure.
h:btn-solve;1
c:solve

p:The gold spheres that appear after solution are regions of high electron density (i.e., likely positions of atoms). Tidy up this solution by clicking the <b>Clean</b> button or by typing '<c>clean</c>' at the command prompt.
h:toolbar-tidy
c:clean
c:refresh

p:It is often helpful at this stage, especially if molecular fragments appear scattered across the screen, to compact them together in the center. To do this, click the <b>Center</b> button or type '<c>compaq -a</c>'.
h:toolbar-center
c:compaq -a
c:legend -r
c:refresh

p:A recognizable skeleton structure of sucrose is displayed on the screen, but all the atoms are carbon! This structure now needs to be 'refined' (correct atoms and atomic positions need to be assigned in the model). To start this important process, click the <b>Refine</b> button. Alternatively, type '<c>refine</c>' at the command prompt.
h:btn-refine;1
c:html.ItemState cbtn* 1 cbtn-refine 2 *settings 0 refine-settings 1
c:SetVar(refinement_output, strcat(FileName(),_refinement_output.html))
c:refine 4 4

p:Every line command has a short help entry describing its function and listing any switches that the command may take. Type '<c>help clean</c>' at the command prompt in the graphics window.
c:lines 15
c:help clean
c:refresh

p:The macro 'Clean' is described in the graphics window. The refined structure will now be cleaned again.
c:clean

p:To identify all non-hydrogen atoms correctly, the <b>Uiso Slider</b> in the <b>Toolbox Work</b> tool tab is first used to select carbons in the skeleton that look relatively small (these are likely to be oxygens).
c:html.ItemState work-main-toolbar 1
c:html.ItemState h3-peak-and-uiso-sliders 1
c:html.setBG(UISO_SELECT_SLIDER,#ff0000)
c:html.setvalue(UISO_SELECT_SLIDER,-7)
c:html.setvalue(UisoSelectVal,<0.035)
c:sel atoms where xatom.uiso < 0.035&&xatom.type!='Q'
c:refresh

p:Convert the selected atoms to oxygens by clicking the <b>O</b> button.
c:spy.ElementButtonStates(O)
c:name sel O
c:sel -u
c:refresh

p:We now refine this updated structure containing the newly identified oxygens.
c:refine 4 4

p:Click the <b>Clean</b> button after the refinement, as before.
c:clean
c:refresh

p:These non-hydrogen atoms are spherical. To make them anisotropic, click on the button showing the anisotropic atom, or just type '<c>anis</c>'.
h:toolbar-anis
c:anis
c:refine

p:Click the <b>Clean</b> button after the refinement once again.
c:clean
c:refresh

p:Let's add some hydrogen atoms to this. Type '<c>hadd</c>' or click on the <b>Add H</b> button.

p:You can toggle the display of electron density peaks (Q-peaks) by repeatedly pressing the <b>Q</b> button or by '<c>CTRL+Q</c>'.

p:Of course, we can change the settings of the solution program.

p:We do this, by clicking the <b>Solution Settings</b> button.
h:cbtn-solve
c:html.ItemState solve-settings 1


p:Here we can choose solution programs and settings...
h:SET_snum_solution_PROGRAM_bg
h:SET_snum_solution_METHOD_bg

p:...set the <b>Formula</b> and can determine the <b>space group</b>.
h:SET_SNUM_REFINEMENT_FORMULA_bg
h:SET_SNUM_REFINEMENT_SPACE_GROUP_bg

p:When you click on <b>Suggest SG</b> link, or type '<c>sg</c>', watch what happens in the graphics window!

p:In order to see all the console output in the graphics window, you can type '<c>lines -1</c>'.

p:To show only 10 lines, type '<c>lines 10</c>'.

p:If you type '<c>text</c>' or press the little text icon, you will get a 'transcript' of the console in your text editor.
