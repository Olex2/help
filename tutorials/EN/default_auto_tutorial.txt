p:The files needed for solving and refining a crystal structure with Olex2 are a reflections file (<b>name.hkl</b>) and an instructions file (<b>name.ins</b>) containing information about the unit cell, radiation type, etc. These files should have the same name and reside in the same folder, normally accessed with the <b>Open</b> button.

p:Olex2 comes with several sample structures, which are shown as buttons in this tool tab. The <b>Sucrose</b> structure will be solved and refined in this tutorial. Press 'Next' to load it.

p:To access all the main solution and refinement tools in Olex2, click the <b>Work</b> tab.
h:tab-work;3
c:html.ItemState * 0 tab* 2 tab-work 1 logo1 1 index-work* 1 info-title 1

p:From this tab, one can <b>Solve</b>, <b>Refine</b>, <b>Draw</b> and produce a final <b>Report</b> for a structure. This tutorial is mainly about the first two of these functions.
h:btn-solve;1
h:btn-refine;1
h:btn-draw;1
h:btn-report;1

p:Click on the arrow next to the <b>Solve</b> button to set the solve options.
h:cbtn-solve; 3
c:html.ItemState cbtn* 1 cbtn-solve 2 *settings 0 solve-settings 1

p:In this tool tab area the solution program (e.g., ShelXT, olex.solve) is chosen and other solve options are set.
h:SET_snum_solution_PROGRAM_bg
h:SET_snum_solution_METHOD_bg

p:This is also where the expected molecular formula is entered in the <b>Composition</b> box and where the <b>Space Group</b> is determined.
h:SET_SNUM_REFINEMENT_FORMULA_bg
h:SET_SNUM_REFINEMENT_SPACE_GROUP_bg

p:Clicking the <b>Suggest SG</b> link generates a table of possible space groups and their relative merits.
c:sg
c:refresh

p:Alternatively, one could type '<c>sg</c>' at the command prompt in the graphics window to suggest a space group. Olex2 has many such line commands. Every line command has a help entry describing its function and listing any switches that the command may take. Type '<c>help sg</c>' to see the entry for the '<c>sg</c>' command.
c:help sg
c:refresh

p:In order to see all the console output in the graphics window, type '<c>lines -1</c>'.
c:lines -1
c:refresh

p:To show only 10 lines, type '<c>lines 10</c>'.
c:lines 10
c:refresh

p:Click on the little text icon near the top of the GUI to open a complete transcript of the console output in your text editor. Or, type '<c>text</c>'.

p:To clear the console output, type '<c>clear</c>'.
c:clear
c:refresh
c:html.ItemState solve-settings 2

p:In the Solve tool tab area, choose a solution program from the <b>Program</b> drop-down menu, make sure <b>name.hkl</b> is loaded as the <b>Reflections</b> file, and enter the expected molecular formula in <b>Composition</b>.
c:spy.set_solution_program(olex2.solve,,snum)
c:html.Update
c:SetVar(solution_output, strcat(FileName(),_solution_output.html))

p:Now click the <b>Solve</b> button.
h:btn-solve;1
c:solve
c:waitfor process
c:refresh

p:The gold spheres that appear after solution are regions of high electron density (i.e., likely positions of atoms) and are called 'Q peaks'. Tidy up this solution by clicking the <b>Clean</b> button or by typing '<c>clean</c>' at the command prompt.
h:toolbar-tidy
c:clean
c:refresh

p:It is often helpful at this stage, especially if molecular fragments appear scattered across the screen, to compact them together in the center. To do this, click the <b>Center</b> button or type '<c>compaq -a</c>'.
h:toolbar-center
c:compaq -a
c:legend -r
c:refresh

p:A recognizable skeleton structure of sucrose is displayed on the screen, but all the atoms are carbon! This structure now needs to be 'refined' (correct atoms and atomic positions need to be assigned in the model). To start this important process, click the <b>Refine</b> button. Alternatively, type '<c>refine</c>' at the command prompt.
h:btn-refine;1
c:html.ItemState cbtn* 1 cbtn-refine 2 *settings 0 refine-settings 1
c:SetVar(refinement_output, strcat(FileName(),_refinement_output.html))
c:refine 4 4

p:Tidy up this refined structure again by clicking <b>Clean</b> or typing '<c>clean</c>' at the command prompt, as before.
c:clean

p:To identify all the non-hydrogen atoms correctly, the <b>Uiso Slider</b> in the <b>Toolbox Work</b> tool tab is first used to select carbons in the skeleton that look relatively small (these are likely to be oxygens).
c:html.ItemState work-main-toolbar 1
c:html.ItemState h3-peak-and-uiso-sliders 1
c:html.setBG(UISO_SELECT_SLIDER,#ff0000)
c:html.setvalue(UISO_SELECT_SLIDER,-7)
c:html.setvalue(UisoSelectVal,<0.035)
c:sel atoms where xatom.uiso < 0.035&&xatom.type!='Q'
c:refresh

p:Convert the selected atoms to oxygens by clicking the <b>O</b> button.
#c:spy.ElementButtonStates(O)
c:name sel O
c:sel -u
c:refresh

p:The Uiso slider method is a coarse technique, and can miss some atom assignments. Select the carbon that was not identified as an oxygen by clicking on it, and convert it to oxygen as well.
c:name C10 O
c:refresh

p:We now refine this updated structure containing the newly identified oxygens.
c:refine 4 4

p:Click the <b>Clean</b> button after the refinement, as before.
c:clean
c:refresh

p:These non-hydrogen atoms are spherical. To make them anisotropic, click on the button showing the anisotropic atom in the <b>Toolbox Work</b> tool tab, or just type '<c>anis</c>'.
h:toolbar-anis
c:anis
c:refine

p:Click the <b>Clean</b> button after this refinement once again.
c:clean
c:refresh

p:The hydrogen atoms will finally be added as appropriate (in 'riding positions'). Click on the <b>Add H</b> button in the <b>Toolbox Work</b> tool tab or type '<c>hadd</c>' and refine again.
#h:small-Add_H
c:hadd
c:refine
c:refresh

p:You can toggle the display of the Q peaks, which now represent regions of residual electron density in the model, by repeatedly clicking the <b>Q peaks</b> button. The equivalent line command is either '<c>Q</c>' or '<c>CTRL+Q</c>'.
h:toolbar-Q
c:showQ a False
c:refresh
