p:The files needed for solving and refining a crystal structure with Olex2 are a reflection file (<b>name.hkl</b>) and an input file (<b>name.ins</b>) containing the crystallographic unit cell that was determined during the diffraction experiment. These files should have the same name and reside in the same directory. Clicking any of the buttons in this tool tab opens these files for a sample structure provided with Olex2. In this tutorial, the <b>Sucrose</b> structure will be solved and refined. Please press 'Next' to load it.

p:The <b>Work</b> tab contains all the main solution and refinement tools in Olex2.

p:From here, one can <b>Solve</b>, <b>Refine</b>, <b>Draw</b> and produce a final <b>Report</b> for a structure.
h:btn-solve;1
h:btn-refine;1
h:btn-draw;1
h:btn-report;1

p:Click on the arrow next to the Solve button to open the options menu. Here, choose a solution program from the <b>Program</b> drop-down menu (e.g., ShelXT, olex.solve), make sure <b>name.hkl</b> is loaded as the <b>Reflections</b> file, and that a sensible chemical composition is entered.
h:cbtn-solve; 1
c:html.ItemState cbtn* 1 cbtn-solve 2 *settings 0 solve-settings 1

p:Click the <b>Solve</b> button or type '<c>solve</c>' into the command window to solve the structure. We will do this now for the sucrose sample structure just opened.
h:btn-solve;1
c:solve

p:The gold spheres that appear after solution are regions of high electron density (i.e., likely positions of atoms). Tidy up this solution by pressing the <b>Clean</b> button or by typing '<c>clean</c>' at the command prompt.

p:Let's press the <b>Refine</b> button or type '<c>refine</c>' and refine what we've got so far.
h:btn-refine;1
c:refine

p:For every instruction that you can use in the graphics window, a short help description tells you the function and possibly switches. If you type '<c>help clean</c>'...
c:help clean
c:refresh

p:...the 'macro Clean' is described in the graphics window. Let's clean once again.
c:clean

p:With the <b>Uiso Slider</b> in the <b>Toolbox Work</b> we can select all those atoms that look 'too small'.

p:...and make them into Oxygen by pressing the <b>O</b> button.
h:btn-elementO
c:name sel O
c:refresh

p:Refine this again...
c:refine

p:...and clean.
c:clean

p:Now it's time to make everything <b>anisotropic</b>. Type '<c>anis</c>' or click on the <b>ANIS</b> button.
h:toolbar-anis
c:anis
c:refine

p:...clean it...
c:clean

p:Let's add some hydrogen atoms to this. Type '<c>hadd</c>' or click on the <b>Add H</b> button.

p:Of course, we can change the settings of the solution program.

p:We do this, by clicking the <b>Solution Settings</b> button.
h:cbtn-solve
c:html.ItemState solve-settings 1


p:Here we can choose solution programs and settings...
h:SET_snum_solution_PROGRAM_bg
h:SET_snum_solution_METHOD_bg

p:...set the <b>Formula</b> and can determine the <b>space group</b>.
h:SET_SNUM_REFINEMENT_FORMULA_bg
h:SET_SNUM_REFINEMENT_SPACE_GROUP_bg

p:When you click on <b>Suggest SG</b> link, or type '<c>sg</c>', watch what happens in the graphics window!
