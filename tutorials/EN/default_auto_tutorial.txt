p:Welcome to this first demo introducing you to <font color="rgb(255,100,50)">Olex2</font color="rgb(255,100,50)">. To get the most out of it, please read this text carefully and when you are done press the 'Next' button.

p:You can exit the tutorial window to move the molecule in the graphics window if you like.<br>If you would like to use the Graphical User Interface (GUI) properly, press 'Cancel' and leave the tutorial.

p:Structures are loaded from the <b>Start</b> tool. The tool will be highlighted when you press 'Next'.

p:You can choose a sample structure by clicking one of the links next to the title <b>Sample Structure</b>. In this tutorial, we will be solving and refining one of the sample structures that come with Olex2 - <b>Sucrose</b>. Please press 'Next' to load it (this may take some time!).

p:By clicking on the <b>Work</b> tab, we get access to the main tools in Olex2:
h:tab-work;3
c:spy.demo.switch_tab_for_tutorials(work)

p:Here we have structure <b>Solution</b>, <b>Refinement</b> and <b>Reports</b>
h:btn-solve;3
h:btn-refine;3
h:btn-report;3

p:To solve your crystal structure with Olex2 you need to provide a reflection file (<b>name.hkl</b>) and an input file (<b>name.ins</b>) containing the crystallographic unit cell you determined during the diffraction experiment.

p:We can solve the structure of our example sucrose by typing '<c>solve</c>' into the graphics window or by clicking the <b>Solve</b> button. We will do this now.
h:btn-solve;1
c:solve
c:waitfor process
c:refresh

p:We can tidy this solution by typing 'clean' or by pressing the <b>Clean</b> button.
h:toolbar-tidy
c:clean
c:compaq -a
c:refresh

p:Let's press the <b>Refine</b> button or type '<c>refine</c>' and refine what we've got so far.
h:btn-refine;1
c:refine

p:For every instruction that you can use in the graphics window, a short help description tells you the function and possibly switches. If you type '<c>help clean</c>'...
c:help clean
c:refresh

p:...the 'macro Clean' is described in the graphics window. Let's clean once again.
c:clean

p:With the <b>Uiso Slider</b> in the <b>Toolbox Work</b> we can select all those atoms that look 'too small'.
c:html.ItemState work-main-toolbar 1
c:html.ItemState h3-peak-and-uiso-sliders 1
c:html.setBG(UISO_SELECT_SLIDER,#ff0000)
c:html.setvalue(UISO_SELECT_SLIDER,-7)
c:html.setvalue(UisoSelectVal,<0.035)
c:sel atoms where xatom.uiso < 0.035&&xatom.type!='Q'
c:refresh

p:...and make them into Oxygen by pressing the <b>O</b> button.
h:btn-elementO
c:name sel O
c:refresh

p:Refine this again...
c:refine

p:...and clean.
c:clean

p:Now it's time to make everything <b>anisotropic</b>. Type '<c>anis</c>' or click on the <b>ANIS</b> button.
h:toolbar-anis
c:anis
c:refine

p:...clean it...
c:clean

p:Let's add some hydrogen atoms to this. Type '<c>hadd</c>' or click on the <b>Add H</b> button.
h:small-Add_H
c:hadd
c:refine
c:refresh

p:You can toggle the display of electron density peaks (Q-peaks) by repeatedly pressing the <b>Q</b> button or by '<c>CTRL+Q</c>'.
h:toolbar-Q
c:showQ False

p:Of course, we can change the settings of the solution program.

p:We do this, by clicking the <b>Solution Settings</b> button.
h:cbtn-solve
c:html.ItemState solve-settings 1


p:Here we can choose solution programs and settings...
h:SET_snum_solution_PROGRAM_bg
h:SET_snum_solution_METHOD_bg

p:...set the <b>Formula</b> and can determine the <b>space group</b>.
h:SET_SNUM_REFINEMENT_FORMULA_bg
h:SET_SNUM_REFINEMENT_SPACE_GROUP_bg

p:When you click on <b>Suggest SG</b> link, or type '<c>sg</c>', watch what happens in the graphics window!
c:sg
c:refresh

p:In order to see all the console output in the graphics window, you can type '<c>lines -1</c>'.
c:lines -1
c:refresh

p:To show only 10 lines, type '<c>lines 10</c>'.
c:lines 10

p:If you type '<c>text</c>' or press the little text icon, you will get a 'transcript' of the console in your text editor.
