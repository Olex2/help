# Refinement Indicators
This table summarizes the most important information about the diffraction data and the quality of the refinement. If any of these standard indicators deviate too far from accepted values, they will be highlighted in red. Although this tool tab is called **Refinement Indicators**, some of the information displayed here (e.g., the various numbers of reflections) is actually solely related to the diffraction data.

## R1 (F<sub>o</sub>>4&sigma;(F<sub>o</sub>))
**R1 (F<sub>o</sub>>4&sigma;(F<sub>o</sub>))** is the *R* factor calculated using only the the strongest reflections, i.e., those with *F*<sub>o</sub> greater than 4&sigma;(*F*<sub>o</sub>).

## R1 (all data)
**R1 (all data)** is the *R* factor calculated using all reflections.

## wR2
**wR2** is a weighted *R* factor based on all reflections, used to track the progress of refinement.

## GooF
Goodness of Fit, a calculated parameter used to optimize the weighting scheme during refinement (a weighting scheme producing a **GooF** close to unity is desirable).

## Highest peak
Gives the height of the largest residual electron density peak.

## Deepest hole
Gives the negative height ('depth') of the largest residual electron density hole.

## Params
Number of parameters (atomic coordinates, displacement parameters, constraints, etc.) used in refinement.

## Refs (total)
Total number of reflections in the diffraction data.

## Refs (uni)
Number of unique reflections in the diffraction data.

## Refs (F<sub>o</sub>>4&sigma;(F<sub>o</sub>))
Number of strong reflections in the diffraction data, i.e., those with *F*<sub>o</sub> greater than 4&sigma;(*F*<sub>o</sub>).

## F000
Structure factor *F*(000) for the *h* = *k* = *l* = 0 reflection. Counts the number of electrons in the unit cell.

## &rho;/g*cm<sup>-3</sup>
Calculated density in g/cm<sup>3</sup>.

## &mu;/mm<sup>-1</sup>
Absorption coefficient calculated from the cell contents, density, and radiation wavelength.

## Mean Shift
Average change in parameters (atomic coordinates, displacement parameters, etc.) between refinement cycles. A large value of the **mean shift** indicates that the refinement has not yet converged, while a value of zero indicates that the refinement has converged.

## Max Shift
Maximum change in parameters (atomic coordinates, displacement parameters, etc.) between refinement cycles. A large value of **max shift** indicates that the refinement has not yet converged, while a value of zero indicates that the refinement has converged.
