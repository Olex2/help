# Electron Density Peak Slider
Move the slider to the left to filter out strongest peaks first, or to the right to filter out weakest peaks first. You can then do things like:


|`name $Q C`|This will only apply to the currently visible peaks.|


The same goes for the 'Select' and 'Delete' buttons. 

# Electron Density Transparancy Slider
The relative peak height is displayed by altering the transparency of the displayed peaks, scaled to the strongest peak. This means that it is very easy to identify when heavy (or non-hydrogen) atoms are missing from your structure. 

### Adjust transparency
With this slider, you can adjust the transparency of the electron density peaks. 

# electron density peaks
Click on these bars to select the corresponding peaks.
