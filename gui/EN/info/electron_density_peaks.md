# Electron Density Transparency Slider
The relative height of Q peaks in the structure is portrayed by their relative transparency: the strongest Q peak is the least transparent and the weakest Q peak is the most transparent. This makes it easy to identify missing heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms in the structure as the least transparent Q peaks. Move the **Transparency** slider to the *right* to make the Q peaks more opaqe and to the *left* to make them more transparent.


# Electron density peaks
This bar chart lists all the Q peaks and their heights. The bars are colour-coded red, orange, and green, in order of decreasing peak height. Click on a bar to select the corresponding Q peak on the screen.
