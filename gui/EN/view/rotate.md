# Rotate
Using this tool, you can control the rotation of the molecule on the screen in a somewhat more fine-grained and repeatable way compared to what can be achieved with the mouse.

## Rotate around the axis x, y and z
Enter the degrees of rotation into the spin boxes, then press the buttons to rotate either in the negative or positive direction.

## Even finer control
Using the command line, rotation about fractions of degrees are also possible:

|`rota 2 -10.2`|This will rotate the structure around the y axis by -10.2 degrees.|



# Auto Rotation
# Auto Rotation
This automatically rotates the structure; x rotates the structure from top to bottom, y rotates from left to right and z rotates around in the plane of the page. The speed of rotation can be set using the slider bar. Clicking on a, b or c resets the view to look down the specific axis.
This is maybe not very useful, but can be fun.

# Zoom Slider
This slider allows you to zoom in and out of your structure. Zooming can also be done by holding down the left mouse key and moving the mouse.
