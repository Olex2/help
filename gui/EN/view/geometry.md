# Calculate Mean Plane
Select atoms that you wish to define a plane for. A plane will be displayed in the ring and a centroid generated, all symmetry related planes will automatically be added to any other molecules on the screen.

# Calculate Best Plane
Select atoms that you wish to define a line for. A line will be fitted and displayed as a 'bond'.

# Distances And Angles
Displays the distance between atoms (for two selected atoms), the angle (for three selected atoms) or the torsion angle, angle and distance (for four selected atoms). 

# Refine With E.S.D Info
Carries out a refinement to save the necessary information to display E.S.D information on parameters. 

# Distances And Angles With E.S.D
Displays the distance between atoms (for two selected atoms), the angle (for three selected atoms) or the torsion angle, angle and distance (for four selected atoms), all with an esd as long as a refinement to save the esd information has been carried out.

# Pi Pi Interactions

Automatically searches for any π-π interactions in your structure. If found the relevant parameters are returned.
