# Stereo View
Depending on the hardware available, there are four options for obtaining a stereo view of a structure. There is also an option for viewing a structure in 3D without any special hardware at all. Click **Normal View** to return to the original 2D view on the screen in all cases. See the Olex2 **3D View tutorial** for more information, or search 3D viewing techniques online.

## Stereo (Colour)
This mode is for viewing a structure using red/cyan 3D glasses. It results in a 3D structure displayed in grayscale (for colours matching those of the glasses). The 3D image is created by rendering two spatially separated projections.

## Stereo (Anaglyph)
This mode is a different method for viewing a structure with red/cyan 3D glasses, and produces colour 3D images.

## Stereo (Hardware)
Requires special hardware (3D monitor and accompanying 3D glasses) to view the 3D image.

## Stereo (Interlaced)
As with **Stereo (Hardware)**, requires special hardware for viewing.

## Normal View
Returns to the normal 2D display mode.

## Viewing a structure in 3D without special equipment
It is possible to generate a 3D image that can be viewed using the 'cross-eyed' method of 'Magic Eye' books, using no special equipment. Type '<c>gl.stereo(cross)</c>' to generate the image. For best results, first resize the entire Olex2 window until the graphics display clearly shows both structures side by side within about a 10 cm x 10 cm square. Cross the eyes (or relax their focus as if staring off into the distance) to view the structure in 3D. The 3D image can be rotated, zoomed, and moved as usual.
