# Fragment Library
This link will open in your default internet browser. Fragments contained in this library can be copied and pasted straight from the web into Olex2.

### Pasted fragments  
These will appear in a strange green colour, and you can then anchor them onto electron density peaks by first clicking on an atom in the imported fragment and then on the corresponding Q-peak. Repeat this progress with another atom/Q pair until a reasonable match is achieved.

### Exit matching mode  
Press **ESC** repeatedly, or press the **ESC** link in the orange mode box to get out of this matching mode. 

## Link Selected 
**Two** Selected atoms will be 'linked' in the refinement.

### Occupancies 
 

|`fvar sel`|The occupancies will be linked such that the individual occupancies add up to unity.|

### Parts and Occupancies   
|`part -p=2 -lo sel`|The occupancies will be linked such that the individual occupancies add up to unity, and the selected atoms will be added to Parts.|


**Note**: the -p parameter determines the number of parts that should be assigned. -lo stands for 'link occupancy'.

## Link Constraints 
Link Parts, Occupancies and apply either and EADP constraint or ISOR restraint to selected atoms.

## Link Parts 1 
Assign selected atoms to the part number selected. 

## Link Parts 2

## Show Parts
If your structure contains atoms that have been assigned to parts, then it is sometimes useful to look only at atoms belonging to the same part. 

|`showP 1`|Will show only atoms belonging to Part 1.|

|`showP 0 2`|Will only show atoms that don't belong to a Part and those that belong to Part 2.|

|`showP 0`|Will show all atoms.|
