# match 1
There are various matching tools available. Please have a look at our online documentation for more info. !!!More Info Online!!!

## Match All Fragments
Where more than 1 of the same fragment is present in a structure, Olex2 will automatically overlay the fragments on the screen and calculate an RMSD deviation for the fragments which is displayed on the graphics screen with and without inversion. Alternatively type match.

## Unmatch
To return to unmatched fragments or type fuse 

# Match 3
Select 3 atoms in the first fragment and then 3 atoms in the second fragment in the order to be matched and Olex2 will overlay the fragments. To return to the unmatched structure click on UnMatch or
 
|`fuse`| Unmatches the structure| 

# Match 4

## Overlay Structure 
Enables the files for the second structure to be loaded, the two structures will then appear on the right and left hand side of the screen. A maximum of three pairs of atoms from the two structure can be selected. The first pair of atoms are superimposed, the second one causes the rotation to minimize the distance between the atoms of the second pair, the third pair causes rotation around the line formed by the first and second pair to minimize the difference between the atoms of the third pair. 

## Mode Match 
This mode enables interactive matching by a maximum of three pairs of atoms. The first pair of atoms are superimposed, the second one causes the rotation to minimize the distance between the atoms of the second pair, the third pair causes rotation around the line formed by the first and second pair to minimize the difference between the atoms of the third pair. Type **ESC** to exit this mode.

## Remove Overlay 
Removes the second structure that has been added.
