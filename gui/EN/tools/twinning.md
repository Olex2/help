# Twinning
These tools provide a ways to assess whether twinning is present in your structure, and to calculate viable twin laws.

## Find 2-fold
This will rapidly search for 2-fold twin laws present in your structure, and present any viable laws for your use.

## Cumulative Intensities
This will generate a graph of the cumulative intensities. If you data follows the bottom line, then your crystal is almost certainly twinned.
