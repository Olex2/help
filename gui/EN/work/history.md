# history-target
All refinements and
solution of the structure
are available from here.

# History
Every step along the process of structure solution and refinement (i.e., every click of the **Refine** button) is automatically recorded by Olex2 in a "History" database. Each coloured bar in this graph represents a single step along the refinement process. Clicking on any of the bars reverts the structure back to its status at that previous step in the refinement.

# History Tree
Every time a structure is solved, a new history branch is created. Using the drop-down menu, the latest structure stored in the selected branch will automatically be loaded. It is possible to delete and rename branches. Click on the appropriate structure solution or refinement branch to return to an earlier structure solution or to an entirely different branch of the refinement process.
