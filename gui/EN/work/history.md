# history-target
All refinements and
solution of the structure
are available from here.


# History
Every step along the process of structure solution and refinement (i.e., every click of the **Refine** button) is automatically recorded by Olex2 in a "History" database. Each coloured vertical bar in this graph represents a single step along the refinement process. The height of each vertical bar represents the R1 value at that step in the refinement process. Clicking on any of the vertical bars reverts the structure back to its status at that previous step in the refinement. Re-refining at this point creates a new branch in the refinement history (see **History Tree** below).

## Left Arrow
Click on the left arrow to see steps further back in the refinement process.

## Right Arrow
Click on the right arrow to see more-recent steps in the refinement process.

## Show All Bars
Click this link to show *all* the steps in the refinement process.

## Split Display
Click this link to show only the last few steps in the refinement process.

## Scale
Larger numbers of **Scale** increase the height of the vertical bars, making it easier to distinguish small changes in R1 value between steps in the refinement.

## Reload INS
Clicking this link will reload the original .ins file from the current working folder for the structure.

## Revert HKL when reverting history
If this box is ticked, when a previous step in the refinement (i.e., vertical bar) is selected from the bar graph above, the .hkl file used will be reverted to the previous version corresponding to that previous step.


# History Tree
Every time a structure is solved, a new history branch is created. Using the drop-down menu, the latest structure stored in the selected branch will automatically be loaded. It is possible to delete and rename branches. Click on the appropriate structure solution or refinement branch to return to an earlier structure solution or to an entirely different branch of the refinement process.

## Condensed
When this box is ticked, an abbreviated version of the history tree will be displayed. If it is left unticked, refinement details for each step will be displayed in the tree.

## Popout
Click this link to open a large pop-up window containing the history tree.
