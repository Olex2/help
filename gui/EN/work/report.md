# h3-source files-help
# Source Files
This tool tab lists the source files used by Olex2 to construct a CIF file for the structure and prints a warning if there is conflicting information among the sources.


# Metadata Sources
Olex2 searches the working folder for sources of metadata such as diffractometer information and data collection parameters, for incorporation into the final CIF file created for the structure after refinement is complete. Such details are normally recorded during the diffraction experiment in a .CIF_OD file. If no files containing metadata are found, Olex2 prints out a brief message to that effect.


# Metadata Conflicts
Olex2 automatically extracts relevant information from metadata source files for inclusion in the final CIF, but the process is not always straightforward because the sources may contain conflicting information. In this case, Olex2 prints an error message and the user has to resolve the conflicts manually, i.e., choose the correct information source for the CIF data.
<br>
<br>

To remove the **<font color="red">There are unresolved conflicts</font>** error message, collapse the **Report** tab and re-expand it, then resolve the conflicts in the window that opens. Click on the **Source Files** tool tab to open and close it. Olex2 will now display a message confirming that all conflicts have been resolved. The **Show ALL** link lists all the sources of CIF data and the **Reset Previously Resolved Conflicts** link removes any manually entered information (causing any previous conflicts to reoccur).


# CIF-Part-1-help
# CIF Part 1
This section deals with the creation and modification of the CIF file, which contains everything known about the structure in a format defined by the IUCr. A complete and correct CIF file is vital for the successful publication of a structure in any peer-reviewed journal. Creation of the CIF is normally handled automatically by Olex2, but these tools are provided in case the CIF needs to be modified.

## Edit CIF Info
Pressing this button will open a file containing all the information that Olex2 will add to the CIF file when it is created. Information entered in the above tool tabs (**Collection**, **Crystal**, **Diffraction**, etc.) will appear here. It is possible to modify the contents of this file, and even add or remove entries. Edits made here will take precedence over any other previously entered values, and the values entered using **Edit CIF Info** will appear when the above tool tabs are reopened.

## Merge CIF
Clicking **Merge CIF** will take the metadata from the source files, the tool tabs above, and information entered using the **Edit CIF Info** button, and merge them into the CIF created during the last cycle of refinement. This final CIF will then be opened in the default text editor.

## Include/Exclude HKL and RES in your CIF
Select from the drop-down menu how reflection data and refinement instructions will be included in the final CIF. **Leave as is** includes the .hkl and .res files as returned by the refinement program. ShelXL includes the HKL and RES information as plain text by default. **Include** incorporates the HKL/RES information in the CIF as a loop (IUCr format). **Exclude** leaves out both the HKL and RES information - this option is strongly discouraged.


# CIF-Part-2-help
# CIF Part 2
The IUCr offer a free error-checking service called ~checkCIF~ for validating CIF files.

## IUCr checkCIF Report
Click the **IUCr checkCIF** button to send the merged CIF to this service for checking. The resulting ~checkCIF~ report may be received in PDF or in HTML format (select from drop-down menu). The report helps identify potential problems with the structure. For full validation of both the CIF and the structure factors, it will also be necessary to upload the structure factors as a .fcf file. For this and other ~checkCIF~ options, see the URL[https://checkcif.iucr.org/,checkCIF] website.

## Depositing a structure with the CCDC
There are two types of submissions to the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (URL[https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/,CCDC]).

### Request CCDC Number
Submitting a structure to the ~Cambridge Structural Database~ (URL[https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/solutions/csd-core/components/csd/,CSD]) is now a requirement for most journals. Click this button to send the CIF file and the optional structure factor file to the CCDC. Once the CIF has been processed, a unique CCDC number will be assigned to the structure and sent by email to the depositing author, usually within a few days. This is the number that needs to be provided to the journal in which the structure is to be published.

Note: To expedite processing, it is important that *all* the required data are provided, i.e., the CCDC forms need to be filled out as completely as possible.
<br>
<br>

If any structure is not published within three years and no other instructions have been received, the CCDC will attempt to contact the depositing author and the corresponding author by e-mail. If no response is obtained, the CCDC will retain the data indefinitely pending future publication. 

### Publish as CSD Communication
Sometimes, a structure is not intended for publication in a scientific journal, but is deposited with the CSD to make it available to other scientists. In such cases, it is possible to publish the structure as a "CSD Communication" by authorising the CCDC to include it directly in the CSD, which occurs as soon as the structure is processed by the CCDC.

# CIF-Part-3-help
# CIF Part 3
One of the really strong points of Olex2 is that it will keep CIF information synchronised throughout the entire solution and refinement process. This is quite a tricky thing to do, but if it all works the way it should, it will never be necessary to edit a CIF by hand again.

## Merge CIF 1
This tick-box is included here only for the very rare cases when problems occur in merging CIF data from the refinement program and information obtained by Olex2. If this box is ticked, as is normally the case, the files that are listed on this line will all be merged with the CIF information. If anything goes dreadfully wrong here with the construction of the final CIF file, untick this box. However, this is really not recommended, and if it ever necessary to untick the box, please send an email describing the problem to **support@olex2.org** so that the issue can be fixed.

## metacif
The **metacif** link opens the file in which Olex2 collects all the information available about the structure. It is also possible to open this file using the **Edit CIF Info** button above, and any edits made will take precedence over all other sources of information, as mentioned earlier.

## Add local/default CIF
This features allows information from an external CIF file to be added to the CIF file being constructed for the current structure. Click **local** if the external CIF file is in the current working folder or **default** to access any of the built-in CIF files of Olex2, e.g., to add information for a specific diffractometer.

# ABS STR
For acentric space groups, the basis on which the decision for the given absolute configuration is based should be specified.

Anomalous dispersion: The absolute structure was derived from anomalous dispersion. See Flack/Bernardinelli[https://doi.org/10.1107/S0021889800007184] for guidelines on how to assess significance and validity of absolute structure parameters like the ones of Flack, Hooft, or Parsons.
Reference molecule: The decision for an absolute structure is based on a chiral reference molecule whose absolute configuration is undoubtedly known.
Reference molecule + AD: As above; Additionally, the assigned absolute configuration is supported by anomalous dispersion.
Synthesis: The absolute structure is based on the configuration of a stereocenter whose configuration remained unchanged during synthetical transformations.
Unknown: There is no chemical evidence or reliable information from anomalous dispersion available that confirms the absolute configuration. Thus, an arbitrary decision on the absolute configuration has been made.
Not applicable

# CIF Part 4
Tick this box to force information from **metacif** to be merged into the final CIF for the structure. Normally, items such as refinement details (and other items listed in the "skip_merge" section of the Olex2 system file *customisation.xlt*) are obtained from the refinement program, not from **metacif**, so this box is usually left unticked.


# ABS STR
The value of the Flack parameter *x* and Hooft parameter *y* are given here for chiral structures. For a correctly determined absolute structure, both are close to 0. If they are close to 1, it may be necessary to invert the structure with '<c>inv -f</c>'. Select from the drop-down menu the method used to determine the absolute structure (most commonly **Anomalous dispersion**).
