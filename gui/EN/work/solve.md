# Solution Program
If particular solution programs are installed in a standard way on your system, Olex2 will find them and they will appear automatically as a choice in the Program drop-down menu. If they don't appear, please make sure that the directory where they are installed is either on the System Path, or has been entered under **Home > Settings > Path**. Please search the web for more information if you have any trouble with this.

## Choice of Programs
Olex2 can make use of many structure solution programs such as

  - **ShelXT**
  - ShelXS
  - ShelXD
  - olex2.solve
  - SuperFlip
  - Sir2011
  - Sir2008

## Solution Method
Select the method you want to use for the structure solution program you have selected. This is only really relevant for **ShelXS** -- all other programs only have one solution method!

# Reflections
Here you can specify the reflection file, which contains in a condensed form all the data that were collected during the X-ray diffraction experiment.

## hkl
The standard format for a reflection file is the **hkl** file. From this drop-down menu, you can choose which file you want to refine your model against. There is no need to rename anything -- just choose the file and then press refine.

## Other Formats
Other file formats (including **raw** and **

# Chemical Formula
The expected chemical composition for the structure. The presence of heavy atoms in the expected composition when they are not actually present in the structure can adversely affect some structure solution programs and vice-versa.

# Z

Z denotes the number of fomula units in the UNIT CELL.

## What is this about?
For molecular compounds this number is easy to see - just count the number of full molecules in the unit cell. For continuous solids and structures that need to be 'grown' it is not always easy to determine this number.
**Note**: Z' (Z prime) is related to this, and denotes the number of formula units in the asymmetric unit.

# Space-Group-help

# Space Group

Usually, you will have determined the space group during data processing.

## Suggest SG

|`sg`|Olex2 can also determine the space group. Press the 'Suggest SG' link and the most likely choices will appear in the drop-down box on the right. You can type 'text' to see the full output of the data analysis.|

You can also type any space group into the box - when leaving the box, your structure will be set up ready to solve in that new space group.
