# Images 
Olex2 can export images in a variety of formats and there are many options available. Atom labelling is also done from here. Options as to what to do if a picture file with the same name already exists are also provided. 

## Move Labels 
You can move the labels using the left mouse button while holding the **SHIFT** key. 

## Delete Labels 
In order to delete a label, make sure no atoms are highlighted (hit **ESC** first!) and then select the label(s) you wish to delete and hit the `Delete` key. You can select all labels by pressing **CTRL+A** after you've selected **one** label. 

# Bitmap Images 
Olex2 can produce bitmap images of your structures in a variety of formats. There is no limit to the size these bitmap images can take. 

## Colour Space  
At the moment, Olex2 saves images in the RGB colour space. If you require CMYK images for your publications, you will find many image conversion services available on the web, where you can upload your RGB file and will get a CMYK file back. 

## Transparancy  
Olex2 does not currently support transparancy. However, you can set the background of your image to some colour that does not occur in your structure (pink is a good choice) and it then becomes very easy to convert all pixels with that colour to transparent in PowerPoint or Word. 

Command: `command line text`

# Bitmap Image Attributes 
These are the properties of the image that will be exported from Olex2. All images will end up in the current structure folder and will not contain any text that is displayed in Olex2 (other than labels, of course!) 

## Name  
If the name box is empty, Olex2 will ask for the filename. Otherwise the given name will be used, regardless of whether the file already exists. 

## Formats  
The default format is the png file format. This format offers lossless compression and is particularly suited to save images from Olex2 while keeping file sizes quite small. There really is no reason to use any other format at all. 

## Size  
There is no limit to the size of the exported bitmap file. If the number given is smaller than 100, the size refers to a multiple of the screen-size. Otherwise it refers to the width of the image in pixels. 

Command (example): `pict fred.png 300`

# Postscript Images
Some would argue that there is no better way to represent a crystal structure on paper than a clear black and white ORTEP drawing. You can make these drawings using Olex2. 

## ORTEP  

|`pictPS`|There are very many different options for generating ORTEP-style drawings. Many of these can be set from this GUI, for some more exotic options you may have to consult the manual of Olex2.|

# Povray Images
POVRAY is a popular format that exports your structure as a 3-D object. Not only can you do beautiful images with rendered shadows and backgrounds with this, but you can make 3-D animations (provided you know PORVRAY!) 

## POVRAY 
There are no options here. Olex2 will export a POVRAY file and you will have to deal with this file yourself! 

Command (example): `pictPR filename.pov`
