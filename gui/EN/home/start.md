# Open a Structure
**Olex2** can read many different crystallographic file formats. When you are working with a crystal structure, the most common way to get into it is by opening a **.ins** file. Typically, a **.hkl** file of the same filename would have been created by your data processing software at the same time. If this pair of files is present in your data folder, you are all set to go.

## Navigate
You can navigate to a file by clicking on the **Open** link under the Start tool, or by using **File > Open** from the menu bar at the top of Olex2.

## Drag and Drop
Alternatively, you can drag and drop any recognised file into Olex2. This file will then be opened, and the current directory will be set to the one where the file was dragged from.

## Command Line

|`reap`|Open a file via the file browser. This command can be followed by a filename: **reap sucrose.ins**, for example. |

# Sample Structures
We provide some sample structures for you to experiment with. These sample structures are copied into your Olex2 user area on start-up. If you delete them, they will come back in their original state on restart.

## Sucrose URL[https://youtu.be/8QvmKSnJFPs,YOUTUBE]
This very simple structure of sucrose (from our coffee room...) is an ideal structure to get started with.

## THPP URL[https://youtu.be/Ruwyh3xmBME,YOUTUBE] URL[https://youtu.be/Gm7KWPDFRUw,YOUTUBE]
An example of a simple disordered structure.

## Co110
A simple coordination complex of Co with two identical ligands.

## ZP2
A structure with *Z*' = 2.

## Water
A metal complex with bound water molecules and one molecule of water of hydration.

## Malbac URL[https://youtu.be/3jC2CVqSkgc, YOUTUBE]
A palladium complex with a molecule of toluene across a symmetry element. This is a good example to practice solvent masking, adding molecules with the FragmentDB tool and also to create such a solvent in the structure model from scratch.

## Timmy
A continuous solid: Calcium tartrate.

# Documentation
We are currently getting all Olex2 documentation into a unified format. In the meantime, we apologize for the slightly haphazard state of our documentation.

## Online
Searchable and structured documentation is available from the OlexSys website.

## Static PDF
We have also provided a PDF manual, which is shipped with this version of Olex2.

## Ilia Guzei's Manual
Besides Ilia Guzei's excellent Olex2 user guide which we have linked in the GUI, you can also try an internet search to look for the extensive amount of third-party help available online for Olex2.
