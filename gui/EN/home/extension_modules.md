# Extension Modules

The **Extension Modules** either provide functionality or make commonly used tasks easier to use. We are currently working on a number of these modules and will make them available for testing as they are ready. You are welcome to test and use them, provided you agree to the following conditions:

  1. We take no responsibility for any modules that are in the testing phase. Please use your own discretion and check everything carefully!
  2. Please tell us about bugs and suggest improvements.
  3. Testing modules will be available for 30 days. After this period, you may get a new version of the module two more times (30 days each). After this period, you must contact us to continue using/testing the modules.
  4. Some of these modules will not be available free of charge after the end of the testing phase.

## Email
You must enter a **valid e-mail address**, select the module you wish to test and then press the button below. An e-mail will be sent to you and you need to **activate it from the link in the e-mail**. After activation, go back to this tool here and select the requested module again from the drop-down menu. This will install the module, which will be available **after restarting Olex2**.

## Reference
This can be any text for your records and that will help you identify the machine where the module has been installed to. Typically this is something like *My Work Computer*.

### List of Extension Modules
All extension modules that are available for this version of Olex2 (version number and also alpha, beta or release) will be listed here. Select the module you are interested in and the 'Please Choose' button will change to 'Install'. Press this button to start the installation.

Note: You must be ~online~ to see the list of available modules! The list will remain empty if you are offline!

## Offline Installation

If it is impossible to perform an online installation of the extension modules, then you may also contact us directly "enquiries@olexsys.org". We will then send you a **.zip** file containing the requested module. Save this file somewhere on your disk and then point to this location after pressing the "Install Offline" button.
