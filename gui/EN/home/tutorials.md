The **Measurements** tutorial deals with how to make geometric measurements on the structure.

## Sorting
This tutorial describes the different ways of sorting atoms in a structure with Olex2.

## Packing
Crystal packing commands available in Olex2 for examining intermolecular interactions are described in this tutorial.

## Mapping & Masks
A large number of mapping and masking tools are available in Olex2; this tutorial shows the user how to employ these tools to analyse a structure.

## 3D View Tutorial
In this tutorial, the user is introduced to the various ways available for viewing a structure in 3D, with and without special equipment.

## Images
Olex2 is capable of making sophisticated graphics files of crystal structures. This tutorial introduces the user to the various options available for creating images of the structure.

## Customising the GUI
This tutorial shows how to modify the appearance of the Olex2 GUI to suit one's needs.
