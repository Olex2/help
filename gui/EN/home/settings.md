# H2_SETTINGS-TARGET
General Settings for Olex2

# Atom Styles
Some attributes of how atoms are displayed in Olex2 can be modified within a specific style.

## Atom Radius
Change the radius of the selected atoms (in PERS mode). Clicking on 'SET' will make this the default. The atom radius can be set manually be set with the commands:

|`arad` | | 

|`azoom`| |

### arad
This parameter affects the radius of the selected (or all, if there is no selection) atoms *in Ball and Stick* (PERS) mode only. Typically, the radius in PERS mode is taken from a definition file (and isn't the same for all elements). **arad** overrides these settings. A typical value for H atoms would be 

|`arad 0.2`| |

### azoom
This *zooms* the displayed atom sizes regardless of whether the atoms are shown in *Ball and Stick** (PERS) or *Ellipsoid* (TELP) modes. This value is given in % -- and scales the selected atoms. 

|`arad 100`| |

shows the original atom size, larger/smaller values vary the display accordingly.
Note: This can play havoc with the ORTEP '50%% probability' convention. In order to ensure that all atoms are shown with the standard probability, please use 

|`telp 50`| |

 -- and if a different probability is desired, use that, e.g. 

|`telp 30`| |

# Bond Settings
Change the radius of the selected bonds. Clicking on `SET` will make this the default. Please note that this will change the radius of *all bonds of the same type*. If you wish to set the radius of a single occurrence of a bond, you must select the bond and type `individualize` first.

# Background
A choice of different backgrounds is available for Olex2. Depending on the context, sometimes a dark background works better than a light one, and sometimes a graduated background is best. It is easy to switch between them.

## Solid Colour/White
**F2** will toggle between the solid colour background (as defined in the scene settings) and a solid white background.

## Graduated Background
**F4** toggles between the solid background and the graduated background. The colour of the graduated background can be set with the `grad` command.

# GUI Width
The width of the GUI (by which we mean the panel with all the commands on) can be adjusted to suit your needs. Try the built-in links, but you can also enter any arbitrary value. The font-size of the items on the GUI will also adjust.

## Value < 1
The GUI width will adjust as a fraction of the screen width **0.33** will divide Olex2 into 2/3 molecule and 1/3 GUI, for example.

## Value > 100
The absolute GUI width in pixels.

Keyboard: `panel 520`, `panel 0.33`

# GUI left/right
Set whether the GUI should be on the left or right of the screen

# Tooltips
If selected, tooltips will be shown when hovering over items.

# Legend
A pictogram of all current atom types appears in the main window. With the left mouse and the pressed SHIFT key, this can be moved to any position. This legend can be switched on and off by typing `legend`.

# Info
If selected, more information on a structure is shown in the top panel.
Keyboard: `showwindow info`
Options: true|false

# Alerts
The `Reset` link will reset all alerts.

# Console Lines
In order to avoid too much clutter on the GUI, we have decided to provide the console output behind the molecule. Here you can set the number of lines of output you would like to see. The commands:

|`lines 10`|will set the console to only show 10 lines.|

|`lines -1`|will show all lines.|

# Save View
When active, drawing settings such as styles and backgrounds will be saved with the structure. This is somewhat experimental; if things go wrong, you may have to reload the chosen style for that particular structure.

When this option is **not** active, then a structure will be loaded with the same style as the previous structure.

If updates to extension modules are availabe, a pop-up box will appear after Olex2 is started. This can be switched off here.
